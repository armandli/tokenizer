Commit all current changes and push to the remote origin on the current branch.

Work through these steps sequentially. Stop early if there are no changes.

---

## Step 1 — Check Status

Run these commands in parallel:
- `git status` (never use `-uall`)
- `git diff` to see unstaged changes
- `git diff --staged` to see already-staged changes

If there are no changes (no untracked files, no modifications, no staged changes), report "No changes to commit." and **stop**.

---

## Step 1.5 — Record Usage

Record this skill's usage now (before staging) so the stats file is included in the commit:

```bash
python3 ${PWD}/.claude/skills/skill-stat/scripts/record-stat.py "commit-push"
```

---

## Step 2 — Stage All Changes

Run `git add -A` to stage everything.

---

## Step 3 — Generate Commit Message

Run these commands in parallel:
- `git diff --cached` to see the full staged diff
- `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commit style

Analyze the staged diff and draft a concise commit message (1-2 sentences) that:
- Summarizes the nature of the changes (new feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
- Focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
- Follows the style of recent commits in the repo

---

## Step 4 — Commit

Create the commit using a HEREDOC to ensure correct formatting:

```
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<commit message here>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

If the commit fails due to a pre-commit hook, fix the issue, re-stage with `git add -A`, and create a **new** commit (never amend).

---

## Step 5 — Push

Get the current branch name:

```
git branch --show-current
```

Then push to remote:

```
git push origin <branch>
```

If the branch has no upstream, use `git push -u origin <branch>` instead.

---

## Step 6 — Report

Show the user:
- The commit hash and message (`git log --oneline -1`)
- The push result (success or failure)
- The branch that was pushed
