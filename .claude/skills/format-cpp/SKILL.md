name: format-cpp
description: Formats C++ code according to 23 specific style rules covering whitespace, braces, preprocessor directives, namespaces, types, formatting, semantic transformations, and naming conventions. Use when user asks to "format my C++ code", "apply C++ style rules", "clean up this C++ file", or "run format-cpp on X". Run refactor-cpp before this skill. Do NOT use for explaining C++ code, debugging, or writing new C++ code from scratch.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Files and Detect C++ Standard

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the target path. Otherwise, ask the user which files to format.

- If a directory is given, find all `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.hxx` files recursively
- If a single file is given, format just that file
- Read each file before modifying it

**Detect the C++ standard version** for the project. Check these sources in order:
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: look for `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`, `target_compile_features(... cxx_std_17)`, or similar
2. `Makefile` / `Makefile.*`: look for `-std=c++17`, `-std=c++20`, etc. in `CXXFLAGS` or compiler flags
3. `.clang-format`, `compile_commands.json`, or other tooling config
4. If no standard can be determined, ask the user

Rules D3, G1, and G3 require C++17 or later. If the project targets C++14 or earlier, skip those rules and note it in the report.

### Step 2: Format Each File

Apply rule groups A through H in order. For each file:

1. Read the file completely
2. Apply all applicable rules (see below)
3. Write the modified file
4. If rule G2 converted any project-local `"header.h"` to `<header.h>`, note the header for Step 3 (build file updates)

**Safety principle**: When uncertain whether a transformation is safe, skip it and warn the user. Never break compilation for style.

### Step 3: Update Build Files (if needed)

If any G2 conversions turned project-local `"header.h"` into `<header.h>`, search for `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, or `BUILD` files in the project:

- Add necessary `-I` include paths so the converted angle-bracket includes resolve
- If no build file is found, warn the user that include paths may need manual adjustment

### Step 4: Report Changes

Summarize what was changed:
- Number of files modified
- Which rule groups were applied
- Any rules that were skipped and why
- Any build file modifications

## Rule Groups

### Group A: Whitespace

**A1 — No tabs.** Replace all tab characters with spaces.

**A2 — 2-space indent.** All indentation uses 2 spaces per level. Convert any other indent width.

**A3 — Namespace body not indented.** Content inside `namespace` blocks sits at the same indentation level as the namespace declaration itself.

**A4 — 80-character target.** Break lines that exceed 80 characters. Prefer breaking at logical points (after commas, before operators). This is a target, not a hard limit — don't break lines if it would harm readability.

### Group B: Braces

**B1 — Same-line opening brace.** Opening `{` goes on the same line as the declaration:
```cpp
if (x) {        // yes
void foo() {    // yes
class Bar {     // yes
```

**B2 — Multi-line signature exception.** When a function signature spans multiple lines, the opening brace goes on its own line, aligned with the function declaration:
```cpp
void very_long_function(
    int param1,
    int param2)
{
  // body
}
```

### Group C: Preprocessor

**C1 — Header guards, not `#pragma once`.** Use `#ifndef`/`#define`/`#endif` guards. The guard name is the filename in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` with `_H` suffix. Replace any existing `#pragma once`.

**C2 — Tidy includes.** Sort `#include` directives in this order, separated by blank lines:
1. Corresponding header (for `.cpp` files)
2. C system headers (`<cstdlib>`, `<cstring>`, etc.)
3. C++ standard library headers (`<string>`, `<vector>`, etc.)
4. Third-party library headers
5. Project headers

Remove duplicate includes.

### Group D: Namespaces

**D1 — No global `using namespace`.** Remove any `using namespace X;` at file/namespace scope. Replace affected unqualified names with qualified names or namespace aliases.

**D2 — Namespace aliases.** When removing `using namespace` or when a qualified name like `std::chrono::seconds` appears 3+ times, introduce a short alias near the top of the function or file scope. Use the predefined alias mapping in [references/namespace-aliases.md](references/namespace-aliases.md).

**D3 — Nested namespace syntax. (C++17)** When namespace blocks are nested, collapse them into a single declaration using `namespace A::B::C {`. Apply this to all consecutive nested namespaces. Add a closing comment reflecting the full path: `}  // namespace A::B::C`. Skip this rule if the project targets C++14 or earlier.

### Group E: Types and Members

**E1 — `struct` over `class`.** Use `struct` instead of `class`. Adjust access specifiers accordingly — what was implicit `private:` in a class must become explicit if needed.

**E2 — Default access first.** In a `struct`, put `public` members first (since that's the default), then `protected`, then `private`. Within each section, order: types/aliases, static members, constructors/destructor, methods, data members.

**E3 — `protected` over `private` for methods.** Use `protected` instead of `private` for member functions, to allow overriding in derived types. Data members may remain `private`.

**E4 — `typename` in templates.** Use `typename` instead of `class` in template parameter lists:
```cpp
template<typename T>   // yes
template<class T>      // no
```

**E5 — Inline small methods.** Methods with 3 or fewer statements should be defined inline in the struct/class body. Move longer methods out-of-line.

**E6 — Enum underlying type.** Every `enum class`, `enum struct`, and plain `enum` declaration must include an explicit underlying fundamental type. If none is specified, add `: int` as the default. Only use a type other than `int` when the enum values demonstrably require it (e.g., a flags enum needing more than 32 bits uses `: uint64_t`, an enum that must fit in a byte uses `: uint8_t`). If the declaration already has an explicit underlying type, leave it unchanged.

### Group F: Formatting

**F1 — One item per line at 80 chars.** When a function call, declaration, initializer list, or template parameter list exceeds 80 characters, put each item on its own line with a trailing indent.

**F2 — Trailing commas.** Add trailing commas in initializer lists, enum values, and macro argument lists where the language permits. This makes diffs cleaner.

**F3 — `break; case` compound style.** In `switch` statements, place `break;` on the same line as the next `case` or `default` label (e.g., `break; case State::Init:`). The first case after `switch {` has no `break;` prefix. The last case/default has no trailing `break;`. Put a blank line between case blocks. When multiple cases share the same handler, group them: `break; case X: case Y:` — the `break;` joins the first label, additional labels follow on the same line.

**F3a — Mandatory `default` label.** Every `switch` statement must have a `default` label. If the original code has no `default`, add one with `assert(false); // should never get here` as the body.

**F4 — Alternative operators.** Use `not`, `and`, `or`, `xor` instead of `!`, `&&`, `||`, `^`. Do NOT convert `&` (binary), `|`, `~`, `!=`, unary address-of `&`, or pointer dereference `*`.

### Group G: Semantic Transformations

**G1 — `string` to `string_view`. (C++17)** Convert `const std::string&` parameters to `std::string_view` when the function does not:
- Store the string (assign to a member, push to a container)
- Pass it to a function requiring `const std::string&` or `std::string`
- Call `.c_str()` or `.data()` on it and pass to C APIs expecting null-terminated strings

Also convert local `const std::string` variables that are only read to `std::string_view`. Add `#include <string_view>` if not already present. Skip when safety is uncertain.

**G2 — Angle-bracket includes.** Convert all `#include "header.h"` to `#include <header.h>`, including project-local headers. When converting project-local headers, note them for build file updates in Step 3 — the build system needs `-I` paths added so angle-bracket includes resolve.

**G3 — No raw-pointer returns to `optional`. (C++17)** Convert functions returning raw pointers (`T*`) to return `std::optional<T>` (for value types) or `std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<T>>` (when reference semantics are needed). Update all callers to use `.value()` or `.has_value()` instead of null checks.

**Exceptions — do NOT convert when:**
- The function is `virtual`, `override`, or part of a polymorphic hierarchy
- The pointer is to a base class (polymorphic usage)
- The function is a factory returning ownership (should use `unique_ptr` instead)
- The function is an extern "C" interface

Add `#include <optional>` if not already present.

### Group H: Naming Conventions

**H1 — Function names: `lower_snake_case`.** Free functions, member functions, and static methods start with a lowercase letter; words are separated by underscores:
```cpp
void this_is_a_function();   // yes
void ParseInput();           // no
void parseInput();           // no
```
**Exceptions — do NOT rename:**
- Constructors and destructors (name is fixed to the class name by the language)
- Operator overloads (`operator+`, `operator==`, etc.)

**H2 — Class names: `UpperCamelCase`, abbreviated when too long.** `struct`, `class`, and `enum` names start with a capital letter; each subsequent word also starts with a capital letter, with no separator characters:
```cpp
struct ClassConcept {};   // yes
struct HttpRequest {};    // yes
struct http_request {};   // no
struct httpRequest {};    // no
```

When the full name would exceed roughly 24 characters, shorten one or more of its constituent words to a well-known abbreviation instead of spelling every word out:
- If the abbreviation cannot be pronounced as a word, write it in ALL CAPITALS: `URL`, `ID`, `DB`.
- If the abbreviation can be pronounced as a word, treat it like any other word in the name — capitalize only its first letter: `JSON` → `Json`, `HTML` → `Html`.

```cpp
// too long (28 chars) — "UniformResourceLocator" -> "URL" (not pronounceable, all caps)
struct UniformResourceLocatorParser {};   // before
struct URLParser {};                      // after

// too long (31 chars) — "JavaScriptObjectNotation" -> "JSON" (pronounceable, becomes a word)
struct JavaScriptObjectNotationParser {}; // before
struct JsonParser {};                     // after
```

Names at or under ~24 characters are left as-is even if they contain a word that has a common abbreviation.

## Error Handling

- **Parse uncertainty**: If you cannot determine whether a transformation is safe, skip it and note it in the report
- **No build file found**: Warn the user but continue formatting; include paths may need manual adjustment
- **Template-heavy code**: Be extra cautious with G1 and G3 in heavily templated code; prefer skipping over breaking
- **C++17 required**: Rules D3, G1, and G3 require C++17 or later. If the standard cannot be detected, ask the user before applying these rules
- **Never break compilation**: If applying a rule would introduce a compile error, skip it
